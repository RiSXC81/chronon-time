Discrete-entropy “Chronon” model: time = count of kB ln 2 entanglement # Chronon-Time

> **Time is the ledger of entanglement.**  
> Every irreducible entropy jump (ΔS = k_B ln 2) is a *Chronon*-tick.  
> Counting those ticks replaces the continuous time parameter with a discrete,
> information-theoretic clock that meshes with relativity, quantum mechanics
> and thermodynamics—and is falsifiable by precision-clock and γ-ray-burst data.

This repository hosts the working paper, reference notes, and code snippets
for exploring the Chronon-Time framework:

* **`CHRONON_TIME.md`** – v2.0 draft of the paper (abstract, formal core, tests).  
* **`notebooks/`** – Jupyter notebooks for Allan-deviation and GRB constraints.  
* **`docs/`** – slides/diagrams and a living bibliography (BibTeX).  

Feel free to open issues, file PRs, or fork experiments.  The goal is to push
the model until it either predicts something new—or decisively breaks.
